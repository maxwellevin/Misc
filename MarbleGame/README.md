 ## Game Rules:
 
 
 1) Player 1 places a marble (1) on the circle and ends their turn.
 2) The next player moves one place on the circle (clockwise) and places a marble after the existing one
 3) If the marble placed is divisible by three, then the player who placed it moves the place 7 spaces on the
 circle and receives points equal to the number of the marble they land on.
